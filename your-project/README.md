## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the correlation between the economy of each country in the United Nations and the pollution emitted by the same country in order to answer the question: "Does sustainable development exist?". Not only will the analysis  give a clear overview on this correlation but also a comparison between the pollution index and industrial production index from developed countries and the ones of developing countries.

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses
The hypotheses formulated for the analysis are:
- The pollution index and the GDP growth are positively and strongly correlated.
- The developing countries have the highest indexes for GDP growth, industrial production and pollution.
- The developed countries have the lowest indexes for GDP growth, industrial production and pollution.
- The developed countries have a bigger GDP per capita than the developing country.
- There is a negative correlation between the GDP per capita and the pollution index.

## Dataset
All the data used for the analysis has been extracted from the [United Nations data web](http://data.un.org). In order to measure the economy of each country we will use the GDP and the GDP per capita, to calculate the pollution from a country we will take into account the CO^2 emissions and also the industrial production index so that we know the type of economy of the country.
